# Linear Regression
## What is linear regression?
Regression analysis searches for relationships between variables. For example you can observe the relation between housing prices and how it depends on certain features such as square footage, location, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, etc. The independent features of each house represents an observation and the price depends on one or more of the features. In linear regression problems the input are continous.

We can use regression to ask what feature are related. We can also use regression to predict the response.   

## Problem formation
To implement linear regression we have dependent variable * *y* * on set of independent variables * *x = (x<sub>1</sub>,...,x<sub>r</sub>)* * where * *r* * is number of predictors. The linear relationship between y and x is * *y=&beta;<sub>0</sub> + &beta;<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub>+...+&beta;<sub>1</sub>x<sub>r</sub>r+&epsilon; where &beta;<sub>0</sub>, &beta;<sub>1</sub>, ..., &beta;<sub>r</sub> are the regression coefficients and &epsilon; is the random error.
