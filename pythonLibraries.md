# Python Libraries for Data

## DATA MANIPULATION
* [__NumPy:__](https://numpy.org/) This libary provides support for large, multidimensional arrays and matricies. Example would be performing mathematical operations on large dataset.
* [__Pandas:__](https://pandas.pydata.org/) This library is good for working with data structure for data manipulation and analysis. This library works well with loading in CSV files into a DataFrame.

## DATA VISUALIZATION
* [__Matplotlib:__](https://matplotlib.org/) This library can be used to plot static, animated and interactive visualizations. 
* [__Seaborn:__](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) This library is built on top of Matplotlib and integrates with Pandas. The library can be used to generate statistical graphics such as heatmaps and correlation matrix.
* [__Bokeh:__](https://bokeh.org/) This graphical library produces interactive visualizations for web browsers. The plots can range from plots to dashboard and are JavaScript-powered, but does not require you to write JavaScript.
* [__Vega-Altair:__](https://altair-viz.github.io/) A declarative visualization library. Uses an API built on Vega-Lite so that less coding is require for visualization.
* [__pygal:__](https://www.pygal.org/en/stable/) A library for creating SVG charts for interactive vector graphics.

** MATHEMATICAL APPLICATIONS
* [__SciPy:__](https://scipy.org/) This library provides algorithms for different mathematical application such as eigenvalue, differential equations, statistics
* [__Statsmodels:__](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) This library works with pandas and provides different statistical models to conduct statistical tests and statistical data exploration
* [__PyMC3:__](https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/stable/learn.html) A Bayesian modeling package for probablistic machine learning application. Example of an application would be to perform a Bayesian inference to estimate the parameters of a linear regression model.
* [__Lifelines:__](https://lifelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) A survival analysis library. 
* [__SymPy:__](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) A symbolic mathematics library

** MACHINE LEARNING
* [__Scikit-learn:__](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) Library with both supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms
* [__TensorFlow:__](https://www.tensorflow.org/) Machine learning library able to build and train deep neural network and optimize LLMs.
* [__PyTorch:__](https://pytorch.org/) Machine learning library to create models, optimize and train model. Provides tensor computation to implement a recurrent neural network (RNN)
* [__JAX:__](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html) Leverages NumPy on CPU, GPU, and TPU for performing machine learning research
* [__XGBoost:__](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python/) A gradient boosting library for training models. This module allos you to load data from different data format including CPU and GPU data structure. 

** NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)
* [__NLTK:__](https://www.nltk.org/) Natural Language Toolkit is a platform that works with symbolic and statistical NLP. 
* [__spaCy:__](https://spacy.io/) NLP processing libary with support for tokenization, parsing, and named entity recognition.
* [__Gensim:__](https://pypi.org/project/gensim/) Library for topic modelling, document indexing and similarity retrieval
* [__TextBlob:__](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) Library with a API for processing textual data and perform tasks such as tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis,and classification. The library is built on top of NLTK

** DATA OPERATIONS AND DEVELOPER TOOLS
* [__Modin:__](https://modin.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) Library that works with Pandas to speed up data preprocessing pipeline
* [__Vaex:__](https://vaex.io/) Library for use with DataFrames to explore tabular datasets and generate data visualization
* [__Dask:__](https://www.dask.org/) Library to scale existing Python libraries to perform parallel analysis. Useful for scaling machine learning pipeline to process dataset
* [__Darts:__](https://unit8.com/resources/darts-time-series-made-easy-in-python/) A library for doing time series modeling
* [__PEP 498:__](https://peps.python.org/pep-0498/) Library that uses f-strings for string interpolation
* [__Jupyter Notebook:__](https://jupyter.org/) An interactive development environment to create code. Good for visualization, live code, equations, and markdown explanataions.
